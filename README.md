 - Support for Twig, MJML out of the box, [easily extensible for other languages](./docs/04-advanced-templating.md).
 - Records sent messages into [Relational DB supported by Doctrine ORM](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/platforms.html).

## Issues / Roadmap
Enveloper is currently in a workable and useful state, with minimal features. Things on the roadmap can be found at https://github.com/outstack/enveloper/issues . Those marked [High Priority](https://github.com/outstack/enveloper/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22High+Priority%22) are likely to be worked on first. 

Create an issue if there's something you'd like to see added, and feel free to tackle any already in the list. Any help is welcomed.
